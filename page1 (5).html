       <li>Apply coupons by typing the website name and the word coupon.(Note not all coupons will work so test everyone.</li>
       <li>Look for discount gift cards from wiki gift cards or card bear. For an example, a coupon code is 20% plus a gift card is 16% to add an additional discount</li>

       <p>input the cost of purchase and it will do the calcuulations for you.</p>
       <li>Check if were gated by clicking the dropdown menu on alerts and and hit manual ungate. Once you hit that, it will take you to amazon seller sentral. Hit request approval and after that,hit apply to sell. If auto approved,you can list. If not find out where i can get it to get ungated with websites provided below. If not found move on.</li>
       <li>Once the product is profitable send me the lead via text message or email and repeat the process when storefront stalking. If not scroll down to the offers tab</li>
       <li>Look for people less than 30 reviews since they did all the hardwork for us.</li>
       <li>Once you found a seller with less than 30 reviews, go through each product on their storefront. Note:sometimes there are auto ungates go try to manual ungate each one</li>
       <li>Start with big name brands that been around customers are buying everyday and recognize</li>
       <li>Steer clear of categories with high return rates like clothing and shoes, and avoid products that are not profitable</li>
       <li>Look for seasonal sales and discounts.</li>
       <li>Avoid offer count going up which can lead the price will go down also known as price tanking, avoid amazon winning most of the time even 100%, avoid amazon at all cost, avoid brand mismatch say for an example the the brand listing said kd products, but the actual brand is gatorade, no one winning the buy box more than 70%, avoid generic brand listings that can lead trademark violations, avoid big drops like for ip complaints like for an example for the past 30 days on the keepa graph the offer count went from 40 and now it dropped to 2.  
       <li>Look for green flags like everybody gets a piece of the pie where scrolling down to buy box anaylsis, consistent pricing and offer count, and slight decrease in offer count an slight increase in pricing.</li>
       <li>Double and triple check the item and upc code matches what is selling on amazon.</li>
